# 📊 **Bangladesh Real Estate Market Insights: A Data-Driven Analysis of Dhaka Housing Prices**

### **A Capstone Project | Data Analysis & Visualization**

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

Dhaka, one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world, faces rapid urbanization and continuous shifts in real estate demand. This project aims to uncover **data-driven insights** into housing prices across major neighborhoods in Dhaka.

Using a combination of **Python, Pandas, data scraping, data cleaning, EDA, statistical analysis, and advanced visualizations**, this study explores:

* Which neighborhoods have the highest/lowest housing prices
* Factors influencing price variations
* Trends, distribution, and patterns in Dhaka’s real estate market
* Data-driven insights useful for buyers, sellers, and policymakers

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. Collect and prepare real estate listing data.
2. Clean, transform, and structure datasets for analysis.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Visualize patterns in Dhaka’s housing prices.
5. Interpret results and generate actionable insights.

## 📈 **Key Analyses Performed**

### ✔ Neighborhood-wise price distribution

Which areas of Dhaka are most expensive / affordable.

### ✔ Price vs. apartment size

Scatter plots, regression lines, correlations.

### ✔ Price variation over time

If time-based data is available.

### ✔ Outlier detection

Identifying luxury or unusually low listings.

### ✔ Interactive visualizations

Plotly dashboards for exploration.

## 🖼️ **Sample Visualizations**

(Add your graphs here later)

* Heatmap of price distribution
* Boxplot of neighborhood comparisons
* Scatter plot of size vs. price
* Interactive map (if created)
