## 📌 **Insights Summary**

1. **Dhanmondi** and **Gulshan** are the most expensive areas in Dhaka, with average property prices exceeding 60M BDT, highlighting the concentration of premium real estate in these well-established, central locations.

2. Suburban areas like **Mirpur** and **Uttarkhan** offer more affordable properties, making them attractive for first-time buyers or those seeking larger homes at lower costs compared to premium zones.

3. The significant price disparity between locations such as **Dhanmondi** and **Rampura** shows the sharp segmentation in Dhaka’s real estate market, catering to both luxury and budget-conscious buyers.

4. **Rampura** and **Shyamoli** are emerging areas with increasing demand, suggesting future opportunities for development in suburban regions that remain more affordable compared to the city center.
